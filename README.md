## Why We Are Creating Judge AI

Combat sports have long been plagued by controversies stemming from subjective and inconsistent judging. High-profile fights often go into the hands of human judges, whose decisions can be influenced by biases, external pressures, or simple errors. For decades, fighters have delivered dominant performances only to face unfair outcomes, especially when a knockout fails to occur.

These issues highlight the need for a fair, transparent, and unbiased system that ensures fighters are judged solely on their performance. Judge AI aims to eliminate these persistent challenges by leveraging technology to bring accuracy and consistency to combat sports judging.

| **Pernell Whitaker vs. Julio Cesar Chavez (1993)** | Whitaker, the reigning WBC welterweight champion, faced Chavez, an undefeated boxing legend. This was seen as a clash of styles, with Whitaker's slick boxing against Chavez's relentless pressure.                                                    | Despite outboxing Chavez throughout the match and landing more punches, the fight ended in a draw. Many felt Whitaker was robbed of a defining career victory. The decision remains one of the most criticized in boxing history, showcasing flaws in the scoring system.                                                                                                           |
| **Lennox Lewis vs. Evander Holyfield (1999)**    | A heavyweight unification bout between Lewis (WBC champion) and Holyfield (WBA and IBF champion). The fight was one of the biggest of the era.                                                                                                         | Lewis dominated with cleaner punches and control, yet the fight was scored a majority draw. The decision faced widespread backlash, prompting a rematch that Lewis won decisively. The initial draw remains a notorious example of controversial scoring in heavyweight boxing.                                                                                                    |
| **Josh Taylor vs. Jack Catterall (2022)**        | Taylor, the undisputed light-welterweight champion, defended his titles against Catterall. The fight was for all four major belts in the division.                                                                                                     | Catterall knocked down Taylor and outboxed him for much of the fight. However, Taylor won by a controversial split decision. The outcome sparked outrage among fans, commentators, and boxing organizations, highlighting issues with judging transparency.                                                                                                                         |
| **Nate Diaz vs. Jorge Masvidal (2024)**          | A highly anticipated match-up between two striking-focused fighters with significant fan bases from their MMA careers.                                                                                                                                | Masvidal appeared to land more significant strikes and control the fight, but Diaz was awarded the victory via a split decision. This sparked debates about potential bias, fighter popularity influencing outcomes, and the competence of judges.                                                                                                                                |
| **Manny Pacquiao vs. Timothy Bradley (2012)**    | Pacquiao, at the peak of his career, faced Bradley in a bout for the WBO welterweight title.                                                                                                                                                           | Despite Pacquiao dominating the fight, Bradley was declared the winner by a split decision. The result was widely condemned and led to an official WBO review confirming Pacquiao as the rightful winner. This fight remains a key example of the need for better oversight of boxing judges.                                                                                   |

These fights exemplify how, even in an era where technology and scrutiny have increased, human judgment can still lead to outcomes that contradict the in-ring performances. The consistency of these events across different eras underscores the persistent challenge in ensuring fair judging in combat sports.
