## Introduction

This project utilizes machine learning algorithms and computer vision techniques to create an AI system that judges combat sports matches. By analyzing key events during a fight (such as punches, kicks, and takedowns), the AI generates a score based on the performance of each fighter. This helps eliminate human error, bias, and external factors that often influence traditional judging in sports.

## Features

- **Fight Scoring**: The AI analyzes real-time fight footage to generate scores based on fighter performance.
- **Unbiased Decision Making**: Eliminates the influence of external factors such as politics, finances, and popularity.
- **Computer Vision Integration**: Uses advanced computer vision algorithms to detect key events during the fight (e.g., punches, kicks, and strikes).
- **Real-time Data Processing**: Processes fight data and provides scoring updates in real time.
- **Machine Learning**: The AI continuously learns and adapts to improve accuracy and fairness over time.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js** (v14 or later)  
  You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
  
- **npm** (Node Package Manager)  
  npm comes with Node.js, so if you’ve installed Node.js, npm should already be installed.

### Cloning the Repository

To get started, you’ll need to clone the repository to your local machine.

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project.
2. Run the following command to clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fight-judge-ai.git
