# Fight Judge AI
This project aims to develop an AI agent for unbiased judging in combat sports. By analyzing fight videos and applying standardized scoring criteria, the AI ensures fair and accurate decisions.

## Features
- Video analysis of fight events.
- Scoring based on strikes, control, and more.
- Dashboard for real-time fight evaluation.

## Technologies
- Machine Learning (TensorFlow or PyTorch)
- Video Processing (OpenCV)
- Backend (Node.js, Python, or similar)

## Roadmap
- **Month 1**: Collect datasets and define scoring criteria.
- **Month 2**: Train AI model.
- **Month 3**: Build and deploy the system.
